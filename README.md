# Game Hub - CS50 Final Project
This is a simple game hub website built using Express. It includes two games: Connect 4 and Connect Flow. The application serves as a platform to play these games in a web browser.


### Built With
* [![Nodejs][NodeJs]][NodeJs-url]
* [![p5js][p5js]][p5js-url]
* [![Nodemon][Nodemon]][Nodemon-url]
* [![Bootstrap][Bootstrap]][Bootstrap-url]



## Requirements
Before you can run the application, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): This is the runtime environment required to run the Express server.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Used to clone the repository from GitHub.

## Setup Instructions
1. First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alohabeach/CS50-Final-Project
```

2. Open the project folder in your terminal:
```bash
cd CS50-Final-Project
```

3. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Once dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:
```bash
npm start
```

5. After running npm start, the application will launch the webpage. The terminal will display the URL where the game hub can be accessed. Typically, it will be something like:
```bash
Access website via either link:
http://localhost:1000
http://127.0.0.1:1000
```



## Games Included
1. Connect 4: A classic 4-in-a-row game where players take turns dropping discs into a grid in an attempt to connect four of their discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

2. Connect Flow: A puzzle game where players must connect pairs of matching numbers on a grid by drawing a path between them, without paths crossing.
